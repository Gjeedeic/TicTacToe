The code in the TCPServer listens for connection from the TCPClient. TCPClient connects to the TCPServer when it calls the server name. Once the connection commerces, It requests the TCPClient for a game. If no, nothing happens, if yes, the request goes to the TCPServer also. If both agree to a game, the code prints out the board reference so the locations  on the board are indicated by numbers. It them prompts the TCPClient for the first move to start the game then the TCPServer goes next after the TCPClient. This continues till the game comes to an end which is when the game board is full where either the TCPServer or TCPClient is the winner or it’s a draw. Whoever wins the game, the code requests if user is interested in another game. If yes another game starts, if not, nothing happens. The same exact thing goes for the UDPServer and UDPClient.
